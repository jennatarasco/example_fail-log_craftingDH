Week 1
At first looking over the course on CULearn I was alittle bit hesitant to contuine taking this course. I have taken many online courses throughout my years at Carleton, but never any that involved retaining the course materials from outside sources. After reading over the manual the first time I was left overwhelemed with the amount of information provided about all the different accounts needed to be made in order to particapte in the materials. After looking over the workbook and the getting started section all my doubts about not being able to even complete week one were gone. Going over each step of the sections and watching all the videos provided, it was a lot easier than I expected and I doubted myself too much from the beginning. I am going into my fourth year of Child Studies and wanted to take a course that was far from related to my program. I wanted to challenge myself into taking a course I had little experience in, so far I am happy I chose this course to challenge my abilities in the digital world. I would say I'm a pretty technological individual when it comes to basic things and gadgets, but when asked to create things and build upon things I have a difficult time. I am excited to see what things course has to bring and how it could help in relation to my field. 

Annotation #1
My first annotation (https://hyp.is/irpyenJhEemDv6cKHtkSfQ/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was pretty bad. I wasn't sure what I was doing and wanted to only post something quick and small so that if something went wrong there wasn't much I would lose. At first I was having a difficult time annotaing because I was clicking 'highlight' first which would then post it automatically. 

Annotation #2
My second annotation (https://hyp.is/M_ZR4HJkEemHIEd5AYvqFA/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was alot easier after experimentting with my first post. It was in response to the VPN. I have never had any expereince with VPN or connecting one from home from campus(although I did used to change my VPN at home to an American one to get all the good Netflix shows). It was a smooth process and the instructions on the Carleton website made it easy to follow step by step.

Annotation #3
My third annotation (https://hyp.is/9Z9S_nJmEem8MiPfNcKdYg/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was in reference with the fail log entries. I was having a difficult time understdaning what the point of these logs were for, but after reading the example it was clear. Just by writing this out I am already feeling good about the progress I have made throughout navigating the workbook and the annotations.
